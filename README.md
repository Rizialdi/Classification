# Kaggle Cassava Leaf Disease Classification

xth place solution for the [Cassava Leaf Disease Classification competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cassava-leaf-disease-classification)

## Context

> As the second-largest provider of carbohydrates in Africa, cassava is a key food security crop grown by smallholder farmers because it can withstand harsh conditions. At least 80% of household farms in Sub-Saharan Africa grow this starchy root, but viral diseases are major sources of poor yields. With the help of data science, it may be possible to identify common diseases so they can be treated.

The aim of the competition is to identify if a crop image presents some signs of disease or not.
